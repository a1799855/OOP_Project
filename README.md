# OOP_Project
Pretty crude rough draft. I spent far too long trying to get the logic for units working. Decided to scrap units for the prototype.<br><br>

To run this you need to install CMake and have the files in a folder somewhere.<br>
The process should be like so:<br>
sudo apt install cmake<br>
cd prototype (or where and whatever you call the folder that the CMakeLists.txt file and src folder)<br>
cmake -S . -B build<br>
cmake --build build -j<br>
./build/oop_project_dummy (name of the executable)
