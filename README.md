# OOP_Project<br>
Same as the prototype:<br>
To run this you need to install CMake and have the files in a folder somewhere.<br>
The process should be like so:<br>
sudo apt install cmake<br>
cd OOP_Project (or where and whatever you called the folder that the CMakeLists.txt file and src folder are in)<br>
cmake -S . -B build<br>
cmake --build build -j<br>
./build/oop_project (name of the executable in the CMakeLists.txt file)
